# juannacry
This repository is strictly for educational and display purposes and is not intended to be used to cause actual harm in a production environment. It includes a text file encryptor and decrypter as well as sample text files to encrypt and decrypt.

This program is designed to be put in a directory that you would like to encrypt and decrypt. All files must be put in that directory because the main encryptor and decryptor functions are imported from separate .py files.
